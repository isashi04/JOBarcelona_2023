# JOBarcelona_2023
This is my submission to the JOBarcelona 2023 Challenge.

In this project I tried to predict if a client is going to unsubscribe from a bank. 

To train the model, I relied on the file called "supply_chain_train.csv" given by the organization.
I based the prediction on a Random Forest classification model, and then tried to improve its performance doing some simple parameterizations.

The final prediction is based on the file "supply_chain_test.csv". and can be found on the file "predicciones.json"
